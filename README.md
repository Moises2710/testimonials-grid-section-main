## Overview

### The challenge

I did this challenge in three three days. I used the BEM method or I tried to use the BEM method for my css name classes, I make this challenge 99% grid and just 1% flexbox, I only used flexbox in the title__name and title__secondary. I used the properties of grid called grid-template-areas and grid-areas for their child. I have not to say, I did my best and I'm satisfied with the result.
